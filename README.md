This app utilizes GET requests sent through android studio code to an online webserver created by an ESP32 microcontroller through Arduino IDE. The webserver receives the requests, and the ESP32 helps turn a motor connected to the flag to raise or lower the flag. Using an MQTT broker in the webserver and incorporating requests with app buttons, the webserver is able to communicate with multiple flagpoles at once. Future plans for this project include improving incorporating an AWS backend to improve logins and possibly using React or other frameworks to allow IOS access along with Androids.
